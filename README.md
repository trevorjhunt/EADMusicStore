# EADMusicStore
This is project created by Trevor Hunt and Mark Feighery for CA2 of the EAD module of the Hdip in science in computing PT year 2.

This project is a music store website, where a user can browse and purchase music albums online. This project is ASP.Net MVC 5 application which maintains the data in that database table i.e. CRUD using the Entity Framework (code first approach). The website is based around an entity framework database design and uses a database that contains multiple tables. The website has a A Restful web service which provides access to the albums stored in the database table (only one operation will suffice) The project also contains a simple console client app for the web service which calls the operation and displays the result.
